    <h3>Introduction and Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Welcome to International Tax! The goal of this course is to acquaint you
        with the fundamental principles of the U.S. international tax regime. 
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      
 <p> This course focuses on the U.S tax rules that apply to cross-border activities, which are comprised of rules applicable to <em>inbound transactions</em>--the taxation of nonresident aliens and foreign corporations on their U.S. activities--and <em> outbound transactions</em>--the taxation of U.S. persons on their activities conducted outside the the United States.</p>  
    <br>

  <p> The tax rules applicable to inbound and outbound transactions are those found in the Code and Regulations and income tax treaties, which alter many of the U.S. international tax rules in the Code. This semester, we'll focus mostly on the U.S.-U.K. tax treaty. </p> 
  
  
  <p>Specific topics to be covered during the semester will include: 
    <ul>
      <li>sourcing rules for allocating income and deductions among several national taxing jurisdictions</li>
      <li>taxation of foreign persons their income derived from U.S. portfolio investments, from U.S. trade or business activities, and from U.S. real property investments</li>
      <li>extra-territorial taxation of U.S. citizens and U.S. corporations that realize income and pay foreign income taxes in foreign countries </li>
      <li>reallocation of income and deductions between U.S. and related foreign enterprises (i.e., transfer pricing)</li>
    </ul> 
          <br>
    
    <p>The knowledge gained in this class is valuable in related corporate law classes, such as M&A, venture capital, and private equity. 
    </p> 

    <br>  
      <p>If you have not taken a basic financial accounting course, I highly recommend that you try to take one somewhere somehow before graduation. One option is next door in the business school--the course is 2 credits and is graded on a pass/fail basis. Like finance, accounting is part of the basic grammar of business discourse, and a little knowledge goes a long way. <a href="Accounting_BSchool.docx">Here are some comments</a> by former students on the class and a list of other business school courses that you can take for credit. Here is a good online Wharton course: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-accounting#syllabus">Wharton Accounting</a>. There are also free accounting courses on LinkedIn Learning, which you can access through my.fordham.edu.  These look decent:  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/financial-accounting-part-1/the-importance-of-accounting?u=80268241">

    <h3>Class Textbook </h3>

        <p>The main textbook that we'll use this semester is <em>International Taxation: A Transactional Approach </em>(ITT). This is a <em>free </em>draft textbook that I've put together for my students.  You can also read  <em>International Taxation in a Nutshell</em> (12th ed) (ITN), which you can access through the FLS library.  
        </p>
        <br>
  
      <h3>Problem Sets</h3>
   
        <p> For each topic, we'll cover problems that are designed to reinforce the sometimes very difficult materials. I will assign the problems to particular students. I highly recommend that you work on the problems in teams.
        </p>

   
        <br>
        

    <h3>Laptops</h3>

      <p>I allow you to use laptops in the classroom, but that doesn't mean you should use them if you are concerned with doing well: <a href="https://goo.gl/XZxnuP">Laptops</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/corpfin20/NoteTaking_Computer_Summary.pdf? ">Laptops2</a>. I suggest that you print out the powerpoint slides and annotate them with your handwritten notes.
      </p>

    <h3>Attendance</h3>
        <p>Attendance is important. An unreasonable number of absences may result in a lower grade.
        </p>

    <h3>Recording</h3>
      <p>For any classes that are recorded this semester, the recordings are the property of the instructor, and students may not download or capture the recordings in any manner, share the recordings, or use them for non-class purposes.
