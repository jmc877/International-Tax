    <h3>Required Texts and Materials</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="Main_22.pdf"> International Taxation: A Transactional Approach</a> (ITT). <strong>{Last revision: 25 Apr 2022 through Ch 12}</strong>.  This is a draft of a textbook on international taxation that I've put together for students.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qnMhubfMJYlq5vn3t7DdDJ_um4q8-KcC5dzmw_5Fx98/edit?usp=sharing"> Suggested corrections spreadsheet.  </a> </li>

      <li>The International Taxation in a Nutshell (12th ed) (ITN) may be useful.  You have free access to it through the <a href="https://lawpac.lawnet.fordham.edu/record=b788050">FLS library</a>.   I've indicated below the applicable sections from ITN for each topic we cover.  </li>
       
      <li>You'll need access to the international tax sections of the Code & Regs.  I prefer paper to digital, but I know that many of you are more comfortable reading online.  I've ordered the U.S Int'l Tax, Selected Sections (2021 ed.) by Foundation Press because it's significantly cheaper ($48) than the CCH version ($199), which I prefer.    Unfortunately, the version from your your basic Income tax class doesn't have the international provisions. I recommend that you keep it next to you to mark up during class and while doing the problems and readings.  You can get by with last year's version.</li>
      
      <li>The Code and Regs are available on line at <a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research">Tax Materials</a>.  This is a fantastic free database of fundamental tax materials.  We will certainty need to access it for the Code and Regs amendments coming this year to the international tax provisions.  On the Supplemental Materials tab, I show how to make a bookmark that will take you directly to the appropriate code or regulation section.  All relevant tax materials are also available on BLaw, WL, Lexis, or Vital Law (formerly Cheetah).</li>
      
      <li>The required Code and Regulations sections that we'll cover for each topic are listed at the beginning of each chapter in ITT.  Additional Code and Regulations sections are listed separately under the topic headings.</li>

      <li>For each topic, first read ITT and then any additional readings and problems.  Use the slides to focus on the important materials that we'll cover during the lectures.</li>


      <li><a href="Build Back Better Act Section by Section.pdf">Build Back Better Section by Section</a> There are some significant changes coming to the U.S. international tax rules.</li>
      
    </ul>

    <h3> Tax Treaty Materials</h3>

    <ul class="readings">
     <small>
      Bi-lateral income tax treaties are a fundamental component of international tax practice.  They change many of the U.S. tax consequences that would otherwise apply in the absence of an applicable treaty.  This semester we'll use U.S.-U.K. tax treaty.   
      
      <li><a href="treaty/Colon UK Treaty Materials.pdf">US-UK Treaty Materials</a> A pdf <strong>with page numbers</strong> of (1) the US-UK Treaty as amended by the protocol; (2) the notes; and (3) the Treasury Technical Explanation.  <strong>This is all you'll need for the semester</strong>.  I distributed a spiral bound copy in class.  Below are the individual treaty materials.</li>

      <li><a href="treaty/uktreaty.pdf">US-UK Tax Treaty</a> This is the US-UK treaty as negotiated and signed.  It does not reflect the amendments in the protocol.</li>
      
      <li><a href="treaty/UKTreaty_CCH_Amend.pdf">US-UK Tax Treaty showing Protocol amendments.</a></li> 
      
      <li><a href="treaty/ukprotoco.pdf">Treaty Protocol</a> This is the protocol amending the US-UK treaty.</li>
      
      <li><a href="treaty/uknotes.pdf"> Notes (further amendments and clarifications) to the US-UK Treaty</a> </li>
  
      <li><a href="treaty/uktreaty_treas.pdf">Treasury Technical Explanation to US-UK Treaty</a></li>
      
      <li><a href="treaty/USModel_16.pdf">2016 US Model Treaty</a> </li>
    
      <li><a href="treaty/USModel_Preamble_16.pdf">Preamble to 2016 US Model treaty</a>   </li>

          <li>When you first read them, don't worry if you don't understand some of the discussion; I'll do my best to clarify it as we cover the materials.  After we cover a particular provision, it might be useful to go back and read the discussion of it in these papers.
           
          <li>For our class on Int'l Tax Theory, please read lightly (skip any numbers or statutory details for now): CRS Intl Tax, pp. 1-11, 26-28, 29-32 and JCT Intl Tax, pp. 4-18 and 35-44.

The majority opinion is pp. 1-7 and much of it is a review of some of the policy motivations of subpart F.  Notice how the dissent focuses on the regulations but the majority does not.  Leg Reg never dies.  This certainly isn't the last word on this issue, but keep in mind the consequences of GILTI, which wasn't yet enacted for the years in question in the case.
